The routine gets updated constantly.\n\n\tI find myself always struggling with sticking to one or more things in the routine, or discover new information that make me want to try new things.\n\tAs a result, this is a constantly changing design of my life.\n \n\tFor example, I tried one meal a day for some months earlier this year, but have switched to the [[02-daily-rambling/Slow carb diet|Slow carb diet]] about a month ago after reading the *4 hour body* by [[Tim Ferriss]]. \n\tI was running 6 miles a day, 6 days a week (Mon to Sat) for the first half of the year, and have switched to the kettlebell swing, again, after reading [[Tim Ferriss]].\n\n2. Five things that are crucial to me: sleep, diet, exercise, journal, mantra.\n\n\tI view them as the pillars that build my life, structures that mold me into a functional human being, and the best medicine for a healthy life,\n\tand I try to make sure I don't skip my meds.\n\n3. I try not to pin each item down to the clocks, like wake up at exactly 6 am, work for exactly 3 hours.\n\n\tI find it stressful if I'm constantly checking the time.\n\tIt's a sign of me wanting to get out of the thing I am doing, and if that's the case I need to rethink if I am doing the wrong thing.\n\n\tI like [[Kevin Kelly]]'s comment that \"productivity is for machines, what humans are good at is wasting time\".\n\tAnd I think the [[paradox]] is true that the more you rush, the slower you go.\n\n4. Life is full of edge cases. It might be all about edge cases. \n\n\tThings go wrong pretty much everyday, and that's the fun part.\n \n\tI like the idea from [[James Clear]] of treating your daily behaviors as casting votes to validate the type of person you're trying to be.\n\tI don't have to win all the votes, I only need the majority.\n\n\tEach day, the focus is to try to show up and cast the vote - especially on the bad days.\n\n5. If you want some thing to happen, crop out a chunk of your time in your day and make it happen.\n\n\tAnother idea from [[James Clear]] that I like, if you want something to happen, take time to do it, or else you should release yourself from the desire/ fantasy that it's gonna happen *some day*.\n \n\t\u003e It doesn't make sense to continue wanting something if you're not willing to do what it takes to get it. \n\t\u003e \n\t\u003e If you don't want to live the lifestyle, then release yourself from the desire.\n\t\u003e \n\t\u003e --- James Clear\n\nI love the [A day in my life](https://youtu.be/0m3hGZvD-0s) video by [[Lex Fridman]].\nI borrowed some of his routines, and sometimes when I struggle with sticking to the routine, I'd rewatch his video to gather some strength from it.\n\nLife's short.\n\nWe've got about 4,000 weeks; 30,000 days; 80,000 working hours.\n\nMake them count.\n\n[^1]: People have proposed that PFC (pre-frontal cortex) should be included in the limbic system, and my instinct is that it should be included. But here the limbic system is the classic model - the amygdala, hippocampus, hypothalamus, etc., not including PFC.","lastmodified":"2023-07-27T14:33:33.714513363Z","tags":["daily rambling"]},"/02-daily-rambling/Allow-things-to-go-wrong":{"title":"Allow things to go wrong","content":"\nLife is an ever-lasting training program,\nand I have so much to learn.\n\nFor me, allowing things to go wrong is an important skill to learn, and to practice to get better at.\n\nThis morning, I woke up feeling not as rested as I thought a 7-hour sleep would provide me,\nand I sat by my bed, feeling annoyed.\n\nIt's not supposed to be. I felt being cheated somehow.\n\nWhen things go wrong, when things didn't go \"my way\", it often stokes a sudden rage in me, I get pissed off and  *before I consciously know it*, my heart rate's fastened, blood pressure rising, adrenaline pumping, my cheek heating up from all the blood rushing to my head, and I am ready to punch someone in the face.\n\nIt's an instinct, a reflex that bypass the commander in chief - the shiny pre-frontal cortex (PFC), the logical circuits of the brain, the ruthless calculator that makes us do the right thing even when it's the harder thing to do, the part that reins in our animal instincts.\n\n(Man do I love the PFC - but then I realize who was generating that thought.)\n\nIt's a faster circuit - emotion has a shortcut to the body, the jumpy fight-or-flight reflex flips on faster than PFC can come to rescue, and tell us that some jerk cutting in front of us isn't all that life threatening, and whispering to the part that's fully to ready punch someone \"you're gonna regret this\" or \" I wouldn't do it if I were you\".\n\nBeing able to acknowledge things do go wrong is an important skill,\nand to me, to accept the truth that we don't have full control of where things go, is a form of courage.\n\nI find it hard for me to *allow* things to go wrong, to *allow* myself to fail, but when I manage to do that, I find letting go of control and accepting the unexpected outcome empowering. \nI find strength and courage in acknowledging the truth: yeah things can go wrong, and a lot of time it's not my fault, but I will take responsibility to fix it.\n\nAnd then the fun begins.\nBecause once I accept this is *my problem*, solving it can be fun - our brain is built to solve problems, it's so amazingly good at it.\nThe problem is *not accepting*, is not willing to face it, being annoyed at it, and burning all the energy on being annoyed and pissed off.\n\nThis probably is some form of stoicism, to stay calm when things go wrong, to resist the instinct to rage, to not give in to anger.\n\nA side note on anger: \noften time I find anger related to losing control. When I'm angry I also find a sense of helplessness, of being hurt by something out of my control.\n\nWhen things go wrong the big way - when tragedy strikes, the second stage of grief (after denial) is anger.\nBut those big hits happen way less frequently, it's usually the small things in the day to day life that get us.\n\nIt's a constant fight, and we don't always win the battle.\nSometimes I would blame myself for being petty and getting pissed at small things, but then I saw Elon Musk on Twitter - a-ha, none of us is immune.\n\nI need to constantly remind myself to allow things to go wrong, and actively practice at getting better it -\nnot only to *allow* it, but to *embrace* it.\n\nWhen chaos arises and things go wrong, it's an invitation to ride the raging wave to destroy, or it can also be a perturbation to the system that reveals new opportunities, or at least, a training session for PFC muscles.\n\nThings are gonna go wrong anyway whether we allow it or not, but we get to choose (at least after the ultra-fast emotions) how we react to it.","lastmodified":"2023-07-27T14:33:33.714513363Z","tags":["daily rambling"]},"/02-daily-rambling/One-blog-a-day":{"title":"One blog a day","content":"\nI want to build a habit of putting out one blog everyday.\n\nThey don't have to be good, in fact I expect most of them to be crappy (like this one).\n\nThe point is to get rid of the friction and get into action -\nit's the mental version of \"making my bed every morning\".\n\nI am recently reading *Tools of Titans* by Tim Ferriss, it's a collection of people Tim has interviewed on his podcast.\n\nIn the segment with *Whitney Cummings*, she mentioned for a doing stand-up comedies, \"the material is 10% of it\".\n\nShe said the best way to get better at stand-up is to get on stage - just get on stage every night, *whether you have material or not*, because the material is like 10% of it.\n\nThe first two years of standup is just getting comfortable on stage, your material doesn't matter.\n\nI think this might apply to writing as well, both articles and codes.

I've been on it for about a month now, and I enjoy it.\n\n## The rules\n\n1. No simple sugar (crystallized, cane, powdered sugar). No starchy food. A simple rule of thumb: if it's white, don't eat it (exception: cauliflower). \n2. Pick a couple of meals and stick to them.\n3. Don't drink calories.\n4. No fruit.\n5. If possible, eat 30g of protein within 30 minutes of waking up.\n6. Take one day off each week and **go nuts**.\n\nThat's it. That's how you do the slow carb diet.\n\n---\n\n## A couple of notes\n\n- The idea is to avoid starchy and simple carbohydrates, to avoid big fluctuations in blood glucose level and extra glucose being turned into fat. That's why no wheat or rice or starch is allowed - no bread, no pasta, no potatoes, no corns, no oats or grains. And no fruit - fructose is a form of simple sugar and will be absorbed very fast.\n- No dairy.\n- My beverage catalog: water, coffee/ decaf, tea, sparkling water, diet coke - no cream/ milk, no sugar.\n- 30g of protein within 30 minutes of waking up, it just works - if you make this one change to your diet and do nothing else, it'll likely help you lose weight - I have no idea why, it's like a secret weapon.\n- Rule #2 might be a bit ambiguous, what meals to choose and what if I get bored? \n\t- I have no problem eating the same food again and again, and I wonder if you keep a log of all the meals you have, you might find out you are actually eating a couple of things again and again too :)\n\t- As for what meals to choose, Tim suggested to choose whatever you like from the following 3 categories, mix and match and do whatever flavor you like (the flavor can't violate the rules of course).\n\t\t- Proteins: eggs, chicken, fish, beef, pork, lamb\n\t\t- Beans: lentils, black/ pinto/ red/ soy beans\n\t\t- Vegetables: spinach, mixed veggies (cauliflower, broccoli, brussels sprouts, other cruciferous vegetables), asparagus, peas, green beans, sauerkraut, kimchi\n- Rule #6, one cheat day each week, eat whatever the heck you want, however much you want - eat all the donuts, cookies, oreos, cholate, cheese cakes, ice creams, pancakes, bagels, fruity drinks, pizzas, cinnamon rolls, croissants, have a carbohydrates feast that would make a diabetes shiver. \n- No need to track calories. If you want to keep a food log out of curiosity, go ahead, but it's not necessary. Eat if you feel hungry, and if you can't stop eating after feeling full (as I sometimes do), that's some level of food addiction and the problem is deeper. I find that addiction is usually a protecting/ coping mechanism to avoid pain, and it won't go away until I address the deeper problem.\n  \nFor more details and information regarding the slow carb diet, go to [Tim's blog](https://tim.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/tim_ferriss_the-4-hour-chef_one_pager_slow_carb_diet.pdf) or his book *The Four Hour Body*.\n\n## What I do\n\n- The same breakfast everyday: 2 eggs, 1 cup of spinach (~80g), 2/3 cups of beans (~150g, lentils and/or black beans). I try to eat it within 30 min of waking up.\n- Skip lunch if I don't feel terribly hungry. Stay hydrated and usually I'm fine. If my stomach feels completely empty for some reason and files a big complaint, I'll eat some mixed veggies (cauliflower, broccoli, carrots) till it feels better. \n- Dinner: \u003e 1lb of mixed veggies (broccoli, cauliflower, brussels sprouts, carrots), \u003e 2 cups of beans (lentils and/or black beans), some kimchi.\n\n- *The glorious cheat day*: I go bunkers. I'm relatively new to the diet and I've only had 4 cheat days so far. I'm still trying to figure out how to do this properly without hurting myself - I would eat so much that my head gets dizzy. \n\t- I am tracking my cheat day in this [[01-dev-logs/food log|food log]]. Here's a snapshot of what I eat last cheat day: 5 donuts, 2 black sesame custard snack, 2 bagels with cream cheese, 1 cookie, 1 pretzel knot, 2 scallion pancakes, 1 diet coke, mixed veggie, spicy soup,  beefless bulgogi, 1 pork bun, 6 pieces of fried chicken, fries, salad, pickles, a little beer, half of a tuna roll, 2 eggs, 1 cup spinach, 2/3 cup beans. I gained 5 lbs the day after, it was glorious.\n\nMy main problem right now is lentils. \nI remember tasting lentils for the first time, I got a pack of [Madras Lentis](https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/madras-lentils-048085) and [Steamed Lentis](https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/steamed-lentils-090240) from Trader Joe's, and they tasted so good that it scared me.\nOn the one hand I am so grateful to have found something I love so much, on the other it's a real struggle with portion control.\nAlas, such is life.\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-27T14:33:33.714513363Z","tags":["daily rambling"]},"/02-daily-rambling/The-power-of-recording":{"title":"The power of recording","content":"\nLike photons, we behave differently when observed.\n\nIn one of his lectures on behavior biology, [[Robert Sapolsky]] mentioned that flashing a pair of eyes for 0.1s when people are playing games - faster than we are consciously aware of, people cheat less --- you are being watched.\n\nWe all behave differently when there's an audience, an observer.\n\nWe get self-conscious, we want to impress others. \nSometimes we feel less alone and get bolder, \nsometimes we get more nervous and screw up.\n\nI heard that once a biomarker becomes a \"marker\", it becomes less good as a measurement - because people are now aware of it and will try to influence it.\n\nIt's so weird but true, but *what gets measured gets fixed*.\n\nIn Tim Ferriss's book *The Four Hour Body*, he mentioned an example of a guy losing a lot of weight by simply measuring his weight for a year - and he made a deliberate effort to NOT change his life style.\nHe plotted his weight by time and defined a range of acceptable weight, and a downward trend within it as how he wanted it to go, \nand like magic, his weight just went down like that.\n\nIn the same book, Tim also mentioned when people take a photo of each meal before eating it, they eat less.\n\nLayne Norton mentioned in a Huberman podcast episode that if you write down everything you put in your mouth, it'll help you follow your diet.\n\nTo record, to simply be *aware*, has real power.\n\nEarlier this year, I set a routine of running 6 miles a day, 6 days a week.\nI had a fitbit on my wrist that recorded every run -\nnot for posterity, posterity rarely cares (the universe doesn't give a flying f\\*ck bout you), but to help hold myself accountable.\nAnd I found it helpful.\nAnother thing is, knowing that this run will soon appear on my fitbit page generated a sense of audience (though I have zero friend on fitbit and know nobody would see it), that made me feel less alone as I ran.\n\nHence I believe the power of recording, of logging stuff, of holding yourself in front of an imaginary audience.\n\nIt'd be helpful to keep a work log, to avoid the empty busyness, to face the burning question of \"I know we are all busy, but what, exactly, is getting done?\"\n\nIt'd be helpful to keep an exercise log, to help hold myself accountable, to make sure I take my daily dose of the best medicine for a healthy, happy life - exercise.\n\nDitto with a diet log, a money log, a book log, a study log (notes), a mood log (journal).\n\nI like measuring stuff.\n\nIt takes courage to look at the truth, the facts, our imperfect self.\n\nKeep an record.

Ensure that code block titles are enabled in Quartz's configuration:\n\n    ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\n    enableCodeBlockTitle: true\n    ```\n\n2. Add the `title` attribute to the desired [code block\n   fence](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlighting-in-code-fences):\n\n      ```markdown {linenos=false}\n       ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n       enableCodeBlockTitle: true  # example from step 1\n       ```\n      ```\n\n**Note** that if `{title=\u003cmy-title\u003e}` is included, and code block titles are not\nenabled, no errors will occur, and the title attribute will be ignored.\n\n### HTML Favicons\nIf you would like to customize the favicons of your Quartz-based website, you \ncan add them to the `data/config.yaml` file. The **default** without any set \n`favicon` key is:\n\n```html {title=\"layouts/partials/head.html\", linenostart=15}\n\u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \n`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\nequivalent to the default:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon:\n  - { rel: \"shortcut icon\", href: \"icon.png\", type: \"image/png\" }\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\n```\n\nIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\n\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \n**Apple touch icon** to Quartz's default favicon:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon: |\n  \u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more \ninformation about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read \n[this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/the-essentials-of-favicons/).\n\n**Note** that all generated favicon paths, defined by the `href` \nattribute, are relative to the `static/` directory.\n\n### Graph View\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/graphConfig.yaml\"}\n# if true, a Global Graph will be shown on home page with full width, no backlink.\n# A different set of Local Graphs will be shown on sub pages.\n# if false, Local Graph will be default on every page as usual\nenableGlobalGraph: false\n\n### Local Graph ###\nlocalGraph:\n    # whether automatically generate a legend\n    enableLegend: false\n    \n    # whether to allow dragging nodes in the graph\n    enableDrag: true\n    \n    # whether to allow zooming and panning the graph\n    enableZoom: true\n    \n    # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\n    depth: 1\n    \n    # initial zoom factor of the graph\n    scale: 1.2\n    \n    # how strongly nodes should repel each other\n    repelForce: 2\n\n    # how strongly should nodes be attracted to the center of gravity\n    centerForce: 1\n\n    # what the default link length should be\n    linkDistance: 1\n    \n    # how big the node labels should be\n    fontSize: 0.6\n    \n    # scale at which to start fading the labes on nodes\n    opacityScale: 3\n\n### Global Graph ###\nglobalGraph:\n\t# same settings as above\n\n### For all graphs ###\n# colour specific nodes path off of their path\npaths:\n  - /moc: \"#4388cc\"\n```\n\n\n## Styling\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\n\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\n\nStill having problems? Checkout our [FAQ and Troubleshooting guide](notes/troubleshooting.md).\n\n## Language Support\n[CJK + Latex Support (测试)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(测试).md) comes out of the box with Quartz.\n\nWant to support languages that read from right-to-left (like Arabic)? Hugo (and by proxy, Quartz) supports this natively.\n\nFollow the steps [Hugo provides here](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/#configure-languages) and modify your `config.toml`\n\nFor example:\n\n```toml\ndefaultContentLanguage = 'ar'\n[languages]\n  [languages.ar]\n    languagedirection = 'rtl'\n    title = 'مدونتي'\n    weight = 1\n```\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-27T14:33:33.714513363Z","tags":["setup"]},"/notes/custom-Domain":{"title":"Custom Domain","content":"\n### Registrar\nThis step is only applicable if you are using a **custom domain**!

You should set the environment variable `HUGO_BASEURL=http://your-public-ip` and then start your container.\n2. Set up port forwarding on your router from port `p` to `your-local-ip:1313`.\n3. You should now be able to access Quartz from outside your local network at `http://your-public-ip:p`.\n\nHowever, your HTTP connection will be unencrypted and **this method is not secure**.\n\n### To a Domain using Cloudflare Proxy\n\n1. Port forward 443 (HTTPS) from your machine.\n2. Buy a custom domain (say, `your-domain.com`) from [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/). Point a DNS A record from `your-domain.com` to your public IP address and enable the proxy.\n3. Set the environment variables `HUGO_BASEURL=https://your-domain.com`, `HUGO_PORT=443`, and `HUGO_APPENDPORT=false`. Change `1313:1313` to `443:443` for the `ports` in `docker-compose.yml`.\n4. Spin up your Quartz container and enjoy it at `https://your-domain.com`!\n\n### To a Domain using a Reverse Proxy\n\nIf you want to serve more than just Quartz to the internet on this machine (or don't want to use the Cloudflare registrar and proxy), you should follow the steps in the section above (as appropriate) and also set up a reverse proxy, like [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik).

You can either create a new Obsidian Vault or link one that your already have.\n\n### New Vault\nIf you don't have an existing Vault, [download Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and create a new Vault in the `/content` folder that you created and cloned during the [setup](notes/setup.md) step.\n\n### Linking an existing Vault\nThe easiest way to use an existing Vault is to copy all of your files (directory and hierarchies intact) into the `/content` folder.\n\n## Settings\nGreat, now that you have your Obsidian linked to your Quartz, let's fix some settings so that they play well.\n\nOpen Settings \u003e Files \u0026 Links and look for these two items:\n\n1. Set the **New link format** to **Absolute Path in vault**. If you have a completely flat vault (no folders), this step isn't necessary.\n2. Turn **on** the **Automatically update internal links** setting.\n\n\n![[notes/images/obsidian-settings.png]]*Obsidian Settings*\n\n## Templates\nInserting front matter everytime you want to create a new Note gets annoying really quickly. Luckily, Obsidian supports templates which makes inserting new content really easily.\n\n\u003e [!WARNING]\n\u003e \n\u003e **If you decide to overwrite the `/content` folder completely, don't remove the `/content/templates` folder!**\n\nHead over to Options \u003e Core Plugins and enable the Templates plugin. Then go to Options \u003e Hotkeys and set a hotkey for 'Insert Template' (I recommend `[cmd]+T`). That way, when you create a new note, you can just press the hotkey for a new template and be ready to go!\n\n\u003e 👀 Step 4: [Preview Quartz Changes](notes/preview%20changes.md)\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-27T14:33:33.718513366Z","tags":["setup"]},"/notes/philosophy":{"title":"Quartz Philosophy","content":"\n\u003e “[One] who works with the door open gets all kinds of interruptions, but [they] also occasionally gets clues as to what the world is and what might be important.” — Richard Hamming\n\n## Why Quartz?\nHosting a public digital garden isn't easy. There are an overwhelming number of tutorials, resources, and guides for tools like [Notion](https://www.notion.so/), [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/), and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), yet none of them have super easy to use *free* tools to publish that garden to the world.\n\nI've personally found that\n1. It's nice to access notes from anywhere\n2. Having a public digital garden invites open conversations\n3. It makes keeping personal notes and knowledge *playful and fun*\n\nI was really inspired by [Bianca](https://garden.bianca.digital/) and [Joel](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden)'s digital gardens and wanted to try making my own.\n\n**The goal of Quartz is to make hosting your own public digital garden free and simple.** You don't even need your own website. Quartz does all of that for you and gives your own little corner of the internet.\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-27T14:33:33.718513366Z","tags":[]},"/notes/preview-changes":{"title":"Preview Changes","content":"\nIf you'd like to preview what your Quartz site looks like before deploying it to the internet, the following\ninstructions guide you through installing the proper dependencies to run it locally.\n\n\n## Install `hugo-obsidian`\nThis step will generate the list of backlinks for Hugo to parse. Ensure you have [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) (\u003e= 1.16) installed.\n\n```bash\n# Install and link `hugo-obsidian` locally\ngo install github.com/jackyzha0/hugo-obsidian@latest\n```\n\nIf you are running into an error saying that `command not found: hugo-obsidian`, make sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly (see [[notes/troubleshooting#`command not found: hugo-obsidian`|the troubleshooting page]])! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize hugo-obsidian as an executable.\n\n##  Installing Hugo\nHugo is the static site generator that powers Quartz. [Install Hugo with \"extended\" Sass/SCSS version](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) first. Then,\n\n```bash\n# Navigate to your local Quartz folder\ncd \u003clocation-of-your-local-quartz\u003e\n\n# Start local server\nmake serve\n\n# View your site in a browser at http://localhost:1313/\n```\n\n\u003e [!INFO] Docker Support\n\u003e\n\u003e If you have the Docker CLI installed already, you can avoid installing `hugo-obsidian` and `hugo`. Instead, open your terminal, navigate to your folder with Quartz and run `make docker`\n\nAfterwards, start the Hugo server as shown above and your local backlinks and interactive graph should be populated! Now, let's get it hosted online.\n\n\u003e 🌍 Step 5: [Hosting Quartz online!](notes/hosting.md)\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-27T14:33:33.718513366Z","tags":["setup"]},"/notes/search":{"title":"Search","content":"\nQuartz supports two modes of searching through content.\n\n## Full-text\nFull-text search is the default in Quartz. It produces results that *exactly* match the search query. This is easier to setup but usually produces lower quality matches.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nenableSemanticSearch: false\n```\n\n## Natural Language\nNatural language search is powered by [Operand](https://beta.operand.ai/). It understands language like a person does and finds results that best match user intent. In this sense, it is closer to how Google Search works.\n\nNatural language search tends to produce higher quality results than full-text search.\n\nHere's how to set it up.\n\n1. Login or Register for a new Operand account. Click the verification link sent to your email, and you'll be redirected to the dashboard. (Note) You do not need to enter a credit card to create an account, or get started with the Operand API. The first $10 of usage each month is free. To learn more, see pricing. If you go over your free quota, we'll (politely) reach out and ask you to configure billing.\n2. Create your first index. On the dashboard, under \"Indexes\", enter the name and description of your index, and click \"Create Index\". Note down the ID of the index (obtained by clicking on the index name in the list of indexes), as you'll need it in the next step. IDs are unique to each index, and look something like `uqv1duxxbdxu`.\n3. Click into the index you've created. Under \"Index Something\", select \"SITEMAP\" from the dropdown and click \"Add Source\".\n4. For the \"Sitemap.xml URL\", put your deployed site's base URL followed by `sitemap.xml`. For example, for `quartz.jzhao.xyz`, put `https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/sitemap.xml`. Leave the URL Regex empty. \n5. Get your API key. On the dashboard, under \"API Keys\", you can manage your API keys. If you don't already have an API key, click \"Create API Key\". You'll need this for the next step.\n6. Open `data/config.yaml`. Set `enableSemanticSearch` to `true`, `operandApiKey` to your copied key, and `operandIndexId` to the ID of the index we created from earlier..\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nsearch:\n  enableSemanticSearch: true\n  operandApiKey: \"jp9k5hudse2a828z98kxd6z3payi8u90rnjf\"\n  operandIndexId: \"s0kf3bd6tldw\"\n```\n7. Push your changes to the site and wait for it to deploy.\n8. Check the Operand dashboard and wait for your site to index.

If you are unfamiliar, [this resource](https://resources.nwplus.io/2-beginner/how-to-git-github.html) is a great place to start!\n\n### Forking\n\u003e A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.\n\nNavigate to the GitHub repository for the Quartz project:\n\n📁 [Quartz Repository](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz)\n\nThen, Fork the repository into your own GitHub account. **Make sure that when you fork, you _uncheck_ the 'Copy the `hugo` branch only' option**.\n\nIf you don't have an account, you can make on for free [here](https://github.com/join). More details about forking a repo can be found on [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).\n\n![[notes/images/fork.png]]\n\n### Cloning\nAfter you've made a fork of the repository, you need to download the files locally onto your machine. Ensure you have `git`, then type the following command in your terminal replacing `YOUR-USERNAME` with your GitHub username.\n\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/quartz\n```\n\n## Editing\nGreat!

Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Quartz.\n\nWhile you're here, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t) :)\n\n### Does Quartz have Latex support?\nYes! See [CJK + Latex Support (测试)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(测试).md) for a brief demo.\n\n### Can I use \\\u003cObsidian Plugin\\\u003e in Quartz?\nUnless it produces direct Markdown output in the file, no. There currently is no way to bundle plugin code with Quartz.\n\nThe easiest way would be to add your own HTML partial that supports the functionality you are looking for.\n\n### My GitHub pages is just showing the README and not Quartz\nMake sure you set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`! See more in the [hosting](/notes/hosting) guide\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](notes/hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile (~/.zshrc if you are on Mac)\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile # again, (~/.zshrc if you are on Mac)\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](notes/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](notes/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](notes/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup analytics?\nQuartz by default uses [Plausible](https://plausible.io/) for analytics. \n\nIf you would prefer to use Google Analytics, you can follow this [guide in the Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/templates/internal/#google-analytics). \n\nAlternatively, you can also import your Google Analytics data into Plausible by [following this guide](https://plausible.io/docs/google-analytics-import).\n\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](notes/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](notes/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect! If you're still having troubles, file an issue in the GitHub repo with as much information as you can reasonably provide. Alternatively, you can message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_jzhao) and I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can.\n\n🐛 [Submit an Issue](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/issues)\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-27T14:33:33.718513366Z","tags":[]},"/notes/updating":{"title":"Updating","content":"\nHaven't updated Quartz in a while and want all the cool new optimizations?
