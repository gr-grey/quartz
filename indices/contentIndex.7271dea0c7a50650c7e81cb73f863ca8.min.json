The routine gets updated constantly.\n\n\tI find myself always struggling with sticking to one or more things in the routine, or discover new information that make me want to try new things.\n\tAs a result, this is a constantly changing design of my life.\n \n\tFor example, I tried one meal a day for some months earlier this year, but have switched to the [[02-daily-rambling/Slow carb diet|Slow carb diet]] about a month ago after reading the *4 hour body* by [[03-my-people/Tim Ferriss]]. \n\tI was running 6 miles a day, 6 days a week (Mon to Sat) for the first half of the year, and have switched to the kettlebell swing, again, after reading [[03-my-people/Tim Ferriss]].\n\n2. Five things that are crucial to me: sleep, diet, exercise, journal, mantra.\n\n\tI view them as the pillars that build my life, structures that mold me into a functional human being, and the best medicine for a healthy life,\n\tand I try to make sure I don't skip my meds.\n\n3. I try not to pin each item down to the clocks, like wake up at exactly 6 am, work for exactly 3 hours.\n\n\tI find it stressful if I'm constantly checking the time.\n\tIt's a sign of me wanting to get out of the thing I am doing, and if that's the case I need to rethink if I am doing the wrong thing.\n\n\tI like [[03-my-people/Kevin Kelly]]'s comment that \"productivity is for machines, what humans are good at is wasting time\".\n\tAnd I think the [[paradox]] is true that the more you rush, the slower you go.\n\n4. Life is full of edge cases. It might be all about edge cases. \n\n\tThings go wrong pretty much everyday, and that's the fun part.\n \n\tI like the idea from [[03-my-people/James Clear]] of treating your daily behaviors as casting votes to validate the type of person you're trying to be.\n\tI don't have to win all the votes, I only need the majority.\n\n\tEach day, the focus is to try to show up and cast the vote - especially on the bad days.\n\n5. If you want some thing to happen, crop out a chunk of your time in your day and make it happen.\n\n\tAnother idea from [[03-my-people/James Clear]] that I like, if you want something to happen, take time to do it, or else you should release yourself from the desire/ fantasy that it's gonna happen *some day*.\n \n\t\u003e It doesn't make sense to continue wanting something if you're not willing to do what it takes to get it. \n\t\u003e \n\t\u003e If you don't want to live the lifestyle, then release yourself from the desire.\n\t\u003e \n\t\u003e --- James Clear\n\nI love the [A day in my life](https://youtu.be/0m3hGZvD-0s) video by [[03-my-people/Lex Fridman]].\nI borrowed some of his routines, and sometimes when I struggle with sticking to the routine, I'd rewatch his video to gather some strength from it.\n\nLife's short.\n\nWe've got about 4,000 weeks; 30,000 days; 80,000 working hours.\n\nMake them count.\n\n[^1]: People have proposed that PFC (pre-frontal cortex) should be included in the limbic system, and my instinct is that it should be included.

I felt being cheated somehow.\n\nWhen things go wrong, when things didn't go \"my way\", it often stokes a sudden rage in me, I get pissed off and  *before I consciously know it*, my heart rate's fastened, blood pressure rising, adrenaline pumping, my cheek heating up from all the blood rushing to my head, and I am ready to punch someone in the face.\n\nIt's an instinct, a reflex that bypass the commander in chief - the shiny pre-frontal cortex (PFC), the logical circuits of the brain, the ruthless calculator that makes us do the right thing even when it's the harder thing to do, the part that reins in our animal instincts.\n\n(Man do I love the PFC - but then I realize who was generating that thought.)\n\nIt's a faster circuit - emotion has a shortcut to the body, the jumpy fight-or-flight reflex flips on faster than PFC can come to rescue, and tell us that some jerk cutting in front of us isn't all that life threatening, and whispering to the part that's fully to ready punch someone \"you're gonna regret this\" or \" I wouldn't do it if I were you\".\n\nBeing able to acknowledge things do go wrong is an important skill,\nand to me, to accept the truth that we don't have full control of where things go, is a form of courage.\n\nI find it hard for me to *allow* things to go wrong, to *allow* myself to fail, but when I manage to do that, I find letting go of control and accepting the unexpected outcome empowering. \nI find strength and courage in acknowledging the truth: yeah things can go wrong, and a lot of time it's not my fault, but I will take responsibility to fix it.\n\nAnd then the fun begins.\nBecause once I accept this is *my problem*, solving it can be fun - our brain is built to solve problems, it's so amazingly good at it.\nThe problem is *not accepting*, is not willing to face it, being annoyed at it, and burning all the energy on being annoyed and pissed off.\n\nThis probably is some form of stoicism, to stay calm when things go wrong, to resist the instinct to rage, to not give in to anger.\n\nA side note on anger: \noften time I find anger related to losing control. When I'm angry I also find a sense of helplessness, of being hurt by something out of my control.\n\nWhen things go wrong the big way - when tragedy strikes, the second stage of grief (after denial) is anger.\nBut those big hits happen way less frequently, it's usually the small things in the day to day life that get us.\n\nIt's a constant fight, and we don't always win the battle.\nSometimes I would blame myself for being petty and getting pissed at small things, but then I saw Elon Musk on Twitter - a-ha, none of us is immune.\n\nI need to constantly remind myself to allow things to go wrong, and actively practice at getting better it -\nnot only to *allow* it, but to *embrace* it.\n\nWhen chaos arises and things go wrong, it's an invitation to ride the raging wave to destroy, or it can also be a perturbation to the system that reveals new opportunities, or at least, a training session for PFC muscles.\n\nThings are gonna go wrong anyway whether we allow it or not, but we get to choose (at least after the ultra-fast emotions) how we react to it.","lastmodified":"2023-09-07T23:13:25.847950859Z","tags":["daily rambling"]},"/02-daily-rambling/Being-fat-is-a-symptom":{"title":"Being fat is a symptom","content":"\nAs if fate would have it, I'm writing this on my cheat day.\n\nI'm following the [[02-daily-rambling/Slow carb diet|slow carb diet]], and Saturday is the scheduled failing day - I eat whatever I want and however much I want.\n\nIt's 15:04 right now, and I've eaten more than 3 meals worth of food.\nI had a breakfast, with 2 eggs, 1 cup of black beans, and a cup of spinach.\nI had a lunch, a chipotle chicken bowl.\nAnd in between, I had half of a tuna wrap, 2 donuts, 2 peanut butter banana dark chocolate bars, 1 big bagel filled with cream cheese, 1 big insomnia cookie, 1 pork bun, some bite size bakery snacks, and some strawberries.\n\nEven during my writing I went for a snack break: 1 slice of pizza, 1 pork bun, 1 cookie and some brussels sprouts 😋\n\n---\n\nI have an unhealthy relationship with food.\n\nAny type of strict diet, including the slow carb diet I follow, probably indicates some sort of distorted relationship with food, and eventually, with wanting to control the body.\n\nI was fat for a long time.\nI weighed about 170 lb from age of 15 to 29.\nAnd last winter, my weight came down to about 136 lb, and I am trying to keep the progress and hopefully get rid of some belly fat.\n\nI'm not fully sure how I lost the weight.\nI think it took about 3 months of daily exercise (swimming for 1h or running for 1.5h) and some diet control (one meal a day).\nI did a bunch of other things, like weighing food to the grams, recording my weight every day. They might have helped too.\n\nLast October, I would think everyday: imagine how much healthier and happier I'd feel, and how much better life would be if I lose 30 pounds.\n\nNow I am on the other side of it with a slimer body, \nand instead of enjoying it,\nI spent way more time in fear, scared that I would go back to being fat again.\n\nIt's yet another example of the illusion we tend to have:\nI'll finally be happy if I \\____ , fill in the blank.\n\nAnyway, I went of the topic.\n\nI struggle with weight loss and eating disorder and being fat, and I think I was going about it the wrong way for a long time, until I realized that for most people, being fat is a symptom.\n\n[[03-my-people/Robert Sapolsky|Robert Sapolsky]] proposed that if you get to the answer of this question, you'd done more good to humanity than anyone since like Jonas Salk invented the Polio vaccine:\n\u003e **why is it that when we feel like nobody loves us, we eat Oreo cookies?**\n\nCarbohydrates are a great tool to release stress, it spikes blood glucose level, which changes the body's stress response - stress hormones like glucocorticoids gets reduced, and we feel a whole lot better - for the short term.\n\nBeing stressed can make one more vulnerable to addiction, when met with the food industry's precisely engineered dopamine inducing foods, food addiction can click like lock and key.\n\nIt makes sense that being poor would be a risk for obesity - it means higher stress level overall, and industrialized engineered food is among the cheapest dopamine they can afford.\n\nI have seen people in serious life crisis or tremendous stress suddenly put on a lot of weight.\nIt might be a protecting mechanism: craving food means there's still something worth chasing in life, and having any source of dopamine is crucial to avoid falling into the deep crevasse of depression.\n\nI think the body's smart, and it's doing the best it can to protect us - depression would be a worse outcome.\n\nI wonder if getting fat, or addiction of any form, or depression, are all symptoms of deeper problems, like our job/ relationship/ family is too toxic for us, or we are insecure or ashamed of our identity, or deep down we feel our life has no purpose, or it's going in the wrong direction, or there are some unhealed mental wounds like trauma.\n\nIt's the body's \"check engine\" light flashing on, it's trying to send us a signal \"hey, somethings wrong with our life, maybe take a closer look and find out what the problem is\".\n\nAnd until we address the deeper problem, the symptom will remain, or if we manage to suppress it in one form, it'll morph into another.\n\nIt's like your hand writing is terrible, but instead of realizing the problem is your hand lacks the skill to produce good hand writing, you decide that it's the pen's fault.\nSo you decide to hate the pen, and every time you pick up the pen you want to snap in half and you slap yourself in the face for using it - you are hurting yourself, ruining the pen, and all the while your hand writing's still terrible.\n(Sorry I make weird analogies.)\n\nFood is a wonderful thing.\nComfort food can release stress, light up our mood;\nfood's an important element of every culture;\npreparing and enjoying food with loved ones are among the best experiences life can offer. \n\nBlood glucose level has access to some of our most ancient circuits.\nTry to be friendly with food,\nand with ourself too ❤️","lastmodified":"2023-09-07T23:13:25.847950859Z","tags":["daily rambling"]},"/02-daily-rambling/Day-2-in-Dallas":{"title":"Day 2 in Dallas","content":"\nI arrived in Dallas from Philly yesterday.\nand instead of being all excited about starting a new life, I feel very tired, and a little homesick.\n\nIt's hard to leave all the comfort and familiarity behind in Philly and start anew.\nI knew where to work, where to exercise, where to get grocery.

I've been on it for about a month now, and I enjoy it.\n\n## The rules\n\n1. No simple sugar (crystallized, cane, powdered sugar). No starchy food. A simple rule of thumb: if it's white, don't eat it (exception: cauliflower). \n2. Pick a couple of meals and stick to them.\n3. Don't drink calories.\n4. No fruit.\n5. If possible, eat 30g of protein within 30 minutes of waking up.\n6. Take one day off each week and **go nuts**.\n\nThat's it. That's how you do the slow carb diet.\n\n---\n\n## A couple of notes\n\n- The idea is to avoid starchy and simple carbohydrates, to avoid big fluctuations in blood glucose level and extra glucose being turned into fat. That's why no wheat or rice or starch is allowed - no bread, no pasta, no potatoes, no corns, no oats or grains. And no fruit - fructose is a form of simple sugar and will be absorbed very fast.\n- No dairy.\n- My beverage catalog: water, coffee/ decaf, tea, sparkling water, diet coke - no cream/ milk, no sugar.\n- 30g of protein within 30 minutes of waking up, it just works - if you make this one change to your diet and do nothing else, it'll likely help you lose weight - I have no idea why, it's like a secret weapon.\n- Rule #2 might be a bit ambiguous, what meals to choose and what if I get bored? \n\t- I have no problem eating the same food again and again, and I wonder if you keep a log of all the meals you have, you might find out you are actually eating a couple of things again and again too :)\n\t- As for what meals to choose, Tim suggested to choose whatever you like from the following 3 categories, mix and match and do whatever flavor you like (the flavor can't violate the rules of course).\n\t\t- Proteins: eggs, chicken, fish, beef, pork, lamb\n\t\t- Beans: lentils, black/ pinto/ red/ soy beans\n\t\t- Vegetables: spinach, mixed veggies (cauliflower, broccoli, brussels sprouts, other cruciferous vegetables), asparagus, peas, green beans, sauerkraut, kimchi\n- Rule #6, one cheat day each week, eat whatever the heck you want, however much you want - eat all the donuts, cookies, oreos, cholate, cheese cakes, ice creams, pancakes, bagels, fruity drinks, pizzas, cinnamon rolls, croissants, have a carbohydrates feast that would make a diabetic shiver. \n- No need to track calories. If you want to keep a food log out of curiosity, go ahead, but it's not necessary. Eat if you feel hungry, and if you can't stop eating after feeling full (as I sometimes do), that's some level of [[02-daily-rambling/Being fat is a symptom|food addiction]] and the problem is deeper. I find that addiction is usually a protecting/ coping mechanism to avoid pain, and it won't go away until I address the deeper problem.\n  \nFor more details and information regarding the slow carb diet, go to [Tim's blog](https://tim.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/tim_ferriss_the-4-hour-chef_one_pager_slow_carb_diet.pdf) or his book *The Four Hour Body*.\n\n## What I do\n\n- The same breakfast everyday: 2 eggs, 1 cup of spinach (~80g), 2/3 cups of beans (~150g, lentils and/or black beans). I try to eat it within 30 min of waking up.\n- Skip lunch if I don't feel terribly hungry. Stay hydrated and usually I'm fine. If my stomach feels completely empty for some reason and files a big complaint, I'll eat some mixed veggies (cauliflower, broccoli, carrots) till it feels better. \n- Dinner: \u003e 1lb of mixed veggies (broccoli, cauliflower, brussels sprouts, carrots), \u003e 2 cups of beans (lentils and/or black beans), some kimchi.\n\n- *The glorious cheat day*: I go bunkers. I'm relatively new to the diet and I've only had 4 cheat days so far. I'm still trying to figure out how to do this properly without hurting myself - I would eat so much that my head gets dizzy. \n\t- I am tracking my cheat day in this [[01-dev-logs/food log|food log]]. Here's a snapshot of what I eat last cheat day: 5 donuts, 2 black sesame custard snack, 2 bagels with cream cheese, 1 cookie, 1 pretzel knot, 2 scallion pancakes, 1 diet coke, mixed veggie, spicy soup,  beefless bulgogi, 1 pork bun, 6 pieces of fried chicken, fries, salad, pickles, a little beer, half of a tuna roll, 2 eggs, 1 cup spinach, 2/3 cup beans. I gained 5 lbs the day after, it was glorious.\n\nMy main problem right now is lentils. \nI remember tasting lentils for the first time, I got a pack of [Madras Lentis](https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/madras-lentils-048085) and [Steamed Lentis](https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/steamed-lentils-090240) from Trader Joe's, and they tasted so good that it scared me.\nOn the one hand I am so grateful to have found something I love so much, on the other it's a real struggle with portion control.\nAlas, such is life.\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-07T23:13:25.847950859Z","tags":["daily rambling"]},"/02-daily-rambling/Stay-in-the-suck":{"title":"Stay in the suck","content":"\nIt seems like the last thing Philly gave me was a sunburn,\nand the first thing Dallas gives me is a cold.\n\nI haven't gotten sick since 2020, I survived the pandemic without catching any symptom or testing positive, and last night I went to bed feeling the typical pain in the throat I'd get before a full blown cold, and my body felt cold that I needed more blankets - it's like an illness forecast: the storms are coming.\n\nI wonder what is making my immune system out of whack,\nmaybe my body haven't adjusted to the dramatic temperature difference between the 76F(24C) indoor and Texas™️ outdoor heat of 106F (42C);\n\nmaybe it was the stress and tension built up before leaving and my body crashing after suddenly being stuck at home all day feeling like doing nothing;\n\nmaybe it's the amygdala pulling the alarm too often in the new environment, burning all the energy and taking up the bandwidth, leaving the immune system poorly funded;\n\nmaybe it's my body's way to get more sleep,\n\nor maybe a cold is simply long overdue.\n\nWhatever it is, a cold feels uncomfortable to say the least.\n\nIt sucks.\nAnd in sucky situations, we often want to run away, to avoid the discomfort, \nto look the other way from the pain.\n\nWe try to conjure up escape places in our mind,\nwe try to sugar coat the situation,\nwe make vague promises to ourselves of future imaginary happiness after the pain stops.\n\n[[paradox|Counter intuitively]], the right thing to do might be to STAY in the suck,\nto stop running from the problem,\nto look pain and discomfort in the eye and say I am not afraid of you.\n\nEven better, try to make it fun, \nlook for growth in a sucky situation,\nlook for hope in the darkest place,\nturn the mistake into a surprising opportunity, or at least a funny meme.\n\nThere's an interesting article published in *Science* in 2010, [A Wandering Mind Is an Unhappy Mind](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1192439).\nThe author provided a TL,DR: \n\u003e In conclusion, a human mind is a wandering mind, and a wandering mind is an unhappy mind.\n\nOur mind seems to have a natural tendency to stray, to defocus, towards chaos and entropy.

Einstein showed energy and matter are equivalent, and quantum computing links information with matter and energy as well.\n![[attachments/energy-matter-information-kevin-kelly-ted-talk.png]]\n\nI think deep down, the power (which could mean literal energy) of language comes from the power of information.\n\nIt might be why the best way to learn something is to try to teach it to someone else, to express the idea in your own language. [[03-my-people/Kevin Kelly|Kevin Kelly]] once said\n\nAnother weird example of language that really impressed me came from [[03-my-people/Robert Sapolsky|Robert Sapolsky]]'s lecture on the insula cortex. The following is adapted from the transcript.

In Chinese, the example is \"道德败坏\".\n\nIt's so weird that languages figured out the neurobiology way before we did.\n\nAnother thing.\n[[03-my-people/Robert Sapolsky|Robert Sapolsky]] has a whole lecture on the biology background of [language](https://youtu.be/nEnklxGAmak?t=179), in which he mentioned a gene **FOXP2** (a transcription factor) that was related to language function.\n\nThe FOXP2 gene exists in all sorts of animals ranging from mammals and birds.\nIt's immensely conserved and haven't changed evolutionarily for a long, long time.\nYou see the same version in everybody else, from mice to apes to birds, but we humans have a *different* version. \nIt was estimated that we diverged from everybody else recently (a couple of thousands years ago), and our mutated version was extremely *positively selected for*.\n\nWhatever this gene is doing, once it went on the human path, it changed real fast under major selective advantageous condition, so we have a different version than everyone else.\n\nAnother thing.\nI have been revisiting the book on trauma *The Body Keeps The Score*. It talked about how defining the condition of PTSD, establishing the concept, giving it a name and label, really helped research booming in the following years.\nHowever, [[03-my-people/Robert Sapolsky|Robert Sapolsky]] also talked about how we should be careful about thinking only within a certain category, being limited in a [*bucket*](https://youtu.be/NNnIGh9g6fA?t=494).\n\nLast thing, on group wisdom.\nAnts can use group wisdom to solve the [[02-daily-rambling/Traveling salesman problem|traveling salesman problem]], which is a NP-hard problem, for details check out this [Sapolsky lecture](https://youtu.be/o_ZuWbX-CyE?t=3291).\nI wonder if language is our version of group wisdom.\nCollectively, we shaped our language together by choosing which words to use and which ones not to, based mostly on what feels right or good to us, and we nailed that insula cortex stuff.\nAnd in a way the large language models like GPT, trained on a good chunk of the texts from the internet, represents our group wisdom by absorbing all the information we've documented using our language.\n\nP.S.\nReading this messy blog after finished, I realized it's basically an implicit ad for lectures from [[03-my-people/Robert Sapolsky|Robert Sapolsky]] 😂.","lastmodified":"2023-09-07T23:13:25.847950859Z","tags":["daily rambling"]},"/02-daily-rambling/The-power-of-recording":{"title":"The power of recording","content":"\nLike photons, we behave differently when observed.\n\nIn one of his lectures on behavior biology, [[03-my-people/Robert Sapolsky]] mentioned that flashing a pair of eyes for 0.1s when people are playing games - faster than we are consciously aware of, people cheat less --- you are being watched.\n\nWe all behave differently when there's an audience, an observer.\n\nWe get self-conscious, we want to impress others. \nSometimes we feel less alone and get bolder, \nsometimes we get more nervous and screw up.\n\nI heard that once a biomarker becomes a \"marker\", it becomes less good as a measurement - because people are now aware of it and will try to influence it.\n\nIt's so weird but true, but *what gets measured gets fixed*.\n\nIn Tim Ferriss's book *The Four Hour Body*, he mentioned an example of a guy losing a lot of weight by simply measuring his weight for a year - and he made a deliberate effort to NOT change his life style.\nHe plotted his weight by time and defined a range of acceptable weight, and a downward trend within it as how he wanted it to go, \nand like magic, his weight just went down like that.\n\nIn the same book, Tim also mentioned when people take a photo of each meal before eating it, they eat less.\n\nLayne Norton mentioned in a Huberman podcast episode that if you write down everything you put in your mouth, it'll help you follow your diet.\n\nTo record, to simply be *aware*, has real power.\n\nEarlier this year, I set a routine of running 6 miles a day, 6 days a week.\nI had a fitbit on my wrist that recorded every run -\nnot for posterity, posterity rarely cares (the universe doesn't give a flying f\\*ck bout you), but to help hold myself accountable.\nAnd I found it helpful.\nAnother thing is, knowing that this run will soon appear on my fitbit page generated a sense of audience (though I have zero friend on fitbit and know nobody would see it), that made me feel less alone as I ran.\n\nHence I believe the power of recording, of logging stuff, of holding yourself in front of an imaginary audience.\n\nIt'd be helpful to keep a work log, to avoid the empty busyness, to face the burning question of \"I know we are all busy, but what, exactly, is getting done?\"\n\nIt'd be helpful to keep an exercise log, to help hold myself accountable, to make sure I take my daily dose of the best medicine for a healthy, happy life - exercise.\n\nDitto with a diet log, a money log, a book log, a study log (notes), a mood log (journal).\n\nI like measuring stuff.\n\nIt takes courage to look at the truth, the facts, our imperfect self.\n\nKeep an record.

Ensure that code block titles are enabled in Quartz's configuration:\n\n    ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\n    enableCodeBlockTitle: true\n    ```\n\n2. Add the `title` attribute to the desired [code block\n   fence](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlighting-in-code-fences):\n\n      ```markdown {linenos=false}\n       ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n       enableCodeBlockTitle: true  # example from step 1\n       ```\n      ```\n\n**Note** that if `{title=\u003cmy-title\u003e}` is included, and code block titles are not\nenabled, no errors will occur, and the title attribute will be ignored.\n\n### HTML Favicons\nIf you would like to customize the favicons of your Quartz-based website, you \ncan add them to the `data/config.yaml` file. The **default** without any set \n`favicon` key is:\n\n```html {title=\"layouts/partials/head.html\", linenostart=15}\n\u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \n`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\nequivalent to the default:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon:\n  - { rel: \"shortcut icon\", href: \"icon.png\", type: \"image/png\" }\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\n```\n\nIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\n\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \n**Apple touch icon** to Quartz's default favicon:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon: |\n  \u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more \ninformation about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read \n[this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/the-essentials-of-favicons/).\n\n**Note** that all generated favicon paths, defined by the `href` \nattribute, are relative to the `static/` directory.\n\n### Graph View\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/graphConfig.yaml\"}\n# if true, a Global Graph will be shown on home page with full width, no backlink.\n# A different set of Local Graphs will be shown on sub pages.\n# if false, Local Graph will be default on every page as usual\nenableGlobalGraph: false\n\n### Local Graph ###\nlocalGraph:\n    # whether automatically generate a legend\n    enableLegend: false\n    \n    # whether to allow dragging nodes in the graph\n    enableDrag: true\n    \n    # whether to allow zooming and panning the graph\n    enableZoom: true\n    \n    # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\n    depth: 1\n    \n    # initial zoom factor of the graph\n    scale: 1.2\n    \n    # how strongly nodes should repel each other\n    repelForce: 2\n\n    # how strongly should nodes be attracted to the center of gravity\n    centerForce: 1\n\n    # what the default link length should be\n    linkDistance: 1\n    \n    # how big the node labels should be\n    fontSize: 0.6\n    \n    # scale at which to start fading the labes on nodes\n    opacityScale: 3\n\n### Global Graph ###\nglobalGraph:\n\t# same settings as above\n\n### For all graphs ###\n# colour specific nodes path off of their path\npaths:\n  - /moc: \"#4388cc\"\n```\n\n\n## Styling\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\n\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\n\nStill having problems?

You should set the environment variable `HUGO_BASEURL=http://your-public-ip` and then start your container.\n2. Set up port forwarding on your router from port `p` to `your-local-ip:1313`.\n3. You should now be able to access Quartz from outside your local network at `http://your-public-ip:p`.\n\nHowever, your HTTP connection will be unencrypted and **this method is not secure**.\n\n### To a Domain using Cloudflare Proxy\n\n1. Port forward 443 (HTTPS) from your machine.\n2. Buy a custom domain (say, `your-domain.com`) from [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/). Point a DNS A record from `your-domain.com` to your public IP address and enable the proxy.\n3. Set the environment variables `HUGO_BASEURL=https://your-domain.com`, `HUGO_PORT=443`, and `HUGO_APPENDPORT=false`. Change `1313:1313` to `443:443` for the `ports` in `docker-compose.yml`.\n4. Spin up your Quartz container and enjoy it at `https://your-domain.com`!\n\n### To a Domain using a Reverse Proxy\n\nIf you want to serve more than just Quartz to the internet on this machine (or don't want to use the Cloudflare registrar and proxy), you should follow the steps in the section above (as appropriate) and also set up a reverse proxy, like [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik).

If you forked and cloned Quartz directly from the repository, everything should already be good to go! Follow the steps below.\n\n### Enable GitHub Actions Permissions\nBy default, GitHub disables workflows from modifying your files (for good reason!). However, Quartz needs this to write the actual site files back to GitHub.\n\nHead to `Settings \u003e Action \u003e General \u003e Workflow Permissions` and choose `Read and Write Permissions`\n\n![[notes/images/github-actions.png]]\n*Enable GitHub Actions*\n\n### Enable GitHub Pages\n\nHead to the 'Settings' tab of your forked repository and go to the 'Pages' tab.\n\n1.

Set a custom domain here if you have one!\n\n![Enable GitHub Pages](/notes/images/github-pages.png)*Enable GitHub Pages*\n\n### Pushing Changes\nTo see your changes on the internet, we need to push it them to GitHub. Quartz is a `git` repository so updating it is the same workflow as you would follow as if it were just a regular software project.\n\n```shell\n# Navigate to Quartz folder\ncd \u003cpath-to-quartz\u003e\n\n# Commit all changes\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"message describing changes\"\n\n# Push to GitHub to update site\ngit push origin hugo\n```\n\nNote: we specifically push to the `hugo` branch here. Our GitHub action automatically runs everytime a push to is detected to that branch and then updates the `master` branch for redeployment.\n\n### Setting up the Site\nNow let's get this site up and running. Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to subdomain your Quartz? That's easy too.\n\nHere, we take advantage of GitHub's free page hosting to deploy our site. Change `baseURL` in `/config.toml`. \n\nMake sure that your `baseURL` has a trailing `/`!\n\n[Reference `config.toml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/config.toml)\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e/\"\n```\n\nIf you are using this under a subdomain (e.g. `\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz`), include the trailing `/`. **You need to do this especially if you are using GitHub!**\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz/\"\n```\n\nChange `cname` in `/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`. Again, if you don't have a custom domain to use, you can use `\u003cYOUR-USERNAME\u003e.github.io`.\n\nPlease note that the `cname` field should *not* have any path `e.g. end with /quartz` or have a trailing `/`.\n\n[Reference `deploy.yaml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml)\n\n```yaml {title=\".github/workflows/deploy.yaml\"}\n- name: Deploy  \n  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3  \n  with:  \n\tgithub_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # this can stay as is, GitHub fills this in for us!\n\tpublish_dir: ./public  \n\tpublish_branch: master\n\tcname: \u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e\n```\n\nHave a custom domain?

There currently is no way to bundle plugin code with Quartz.\n\nThe easiest way would be to add your own HTML partial that supports the functionality you are looking for.\n\n### My GitHub pages is just showing the README and not Quartz\nMake sure you set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`! See more in the [hosting](/notes/hosting) guide\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](notes/hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile (~/.zshrc if you are on Mac)\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile # again, (~/.zshrc if you are on Mac)\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](notes/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](notes/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](notes/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup analytics?\nQuartz by default uses [Plausible](https://plausible.io/) for analytics. \n\nIf you would prefer to use Google Analytics, you can follow this [guide in the Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/templates/internal/#google-analytics). \n\nAlternatively, you can also import your Google Analytics data into Plausible by [following this guide](https://plausible.io/docs/google-analytics-import).\n\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](notes/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](notes/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect! If you're still having troubles, file an issue in the GitHub repo with as much information as you can reasonably provide. Alternatively, you can message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_jzhao) and I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can.\n\n🐛 [Submit an Issue](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/issues)\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-07T23:13:25.863951118Z","tags":[]},"/notes/updating":{"title":"Updating","content":"\nHaven't updated Quartz in a while and want all the cool new optimizations?
