I wonder if the body craving more food after being full comes is related with having food shortage in childhood.

My brain learned at a young age that food is scarcity, it's an important resource that we need to stock up, as much as I can.

One day my PFC might be able to rewire it, to convince the body that we are in safe zone now, that there's enough food, and we can stop eating now.
