Note:

I seems to be getting better at this.
Originally really worried because I've been stressed out and emotionally all over the place after relocated to Dallas this week.

Then a bunch of  things went wrong and I felt like I couldn't catch a break.
I thought today was going to be rough.

But reunited with my old roommate and having fried chicken with her made my week ðŸ˜‹
It was another small yet solid piece of evidence that we as humans hold great power to heal each other with care and love.

And reminding myself to be less judgy also helped.

I wonder if the body craving more food after being full comes is related with having food shortage in childhood.

My brain learned at a young age that food is scarcity, it's an important resource that we need to stock up, as much as I can.

One day my PFC might be able to rewire it, to convince the body that we are in safe zone now, that there's enough food, and we can stop eating now.

2 KIND peanut butter banana dark chocolate bar,
2 donuts, 1 bagel with cream cheese,
