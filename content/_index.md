Just keep [[02-daily-rambling/The power of recording|logging]], 
because like photons, we behave differently when observed.

Currently trying to put out my [ramblings](/tags/ramblings) on most days.

Other pages are
[logs](/tags/dev-logs),
[my people](/tags/my-people),
[garden](/04-garden), 
and [learning notes](/05-learning).

This site is built by the wonderful [Quartz 4 (jzhao.xyz)](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/)!

My old site is archived as [prototype1](https://gr-grey.github.io/proto1/).

Reasons for switching (from the old Jekyll template).

- Use links and graphs with obsidian.
- Faster rendering.
- More recent developed template with features like dark mode, code block copy button, TOC, emojis, etc.
