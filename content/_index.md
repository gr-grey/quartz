Just keep [[02-daily-rambling/The power of recording|logging]], 
because like photons, we behave differently when observed.

Currently trying to put out my [ramblings](/tags/daily-rambling/) on most days.

Other pages are
[logs](/tags/dev-log) and
[my people](/tags/my-people).

Rebuilding my website with [ðŸª´ Quartz 3.3 (jzhao.xyz)](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/).


My old site is archived as [prototype1](https://gr-grey.github.io/proto1/), it seems you need to refresh once for the link to work, and some pics and files might be missing because of the change in base url.

Reasons for switching (from the old Jekyll template).

- Use links and graphs with obsidian.
- Faster rendering.
- More recent developed template with features like dark mode, code block copy button, TOC, emojis, etc.
