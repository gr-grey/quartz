Rebuilding my website with [ðŸª´ Quartz 3.3 (jzhao.xyz)](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/).

My old site is archived as [prototype1](https://gr-grey.github.io/proto1/), some links might not be working because of the change in base url.

Reasons for switching (from the old Jekyll template).

- Use links and graphs with obsidian.
- Faster rendering.
- More recent developed template with features like dark mode, code block copy button, TOC, emojis, etc.
