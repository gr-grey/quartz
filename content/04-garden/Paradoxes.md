> Much of life's challenges are not problems that we solve, they are paradoxes that we manage.

1. There is no free will[^1] but there's always choosing.

2. The more you give, the more you'll get.

3. Discipline = freedom.

4. Bravery is defined by vulnerability[^2].

5. Weird-ass philosophies that demonstrate human's unique capability to hold contradictory thoughts[^3].

	- The less forgivable the act, the more it must be forgiven.
	- The less lovable the person is, the more you must find the means to love them.

	These thoughts take the impossibility of something, to be the very proof that it must be possible, and must become a moral imperative.

	As we learn more about the world, we have to come to the conclusion that, at the end of the day, it's really impossible for one person to make a difference.

	Thus the the more clearly, absolutely, utterly unchangeably clear it is that,
 
	 > It is impossible for you to make a difference and make the world better, the more you must.

6. The rich don't work for money[^4].

7. We love a sense of control, 
we also love losing control in a controlled setting (being surprised).

8. We tend to have the impression that we know about most things, we've figure out most of how the world works, but look at our records, we probably know close to nothing about anything[^5].

9. Happiness lies on the other end of suffering[^6].

10. The high of pleasure comes with a shadow of pain rising with it. The higher the pleasure, the higher the pain (of withdrawal)[^7].

11.  Love and hate share very similar biological profiles (level of arousal, neurotransmitter, etc.). 

        > The opposite of love is not hate, it's indifference.

      While we are at it, there's another quote I like from Sapolsky:

      > The opposite of play is not work, it's depression.

[^1]: This is certainly debatable, but many people believe that. For example, [[Robert Sapolsky]] said, when it comes to free will, I don't think there's a single shred of it.

[^2]: From Sapolsky's [Class Day Lecture 2009: The Uniqueness of Humans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrCVu25wQ5s&list=LL&index=4) by Stanford University.

[^3]: From [[Bren√© Brown]] talk at south by southwest. [SXSWedu 2017 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVD8YRgA-ck&list=LL&index=27).

[^4]: One of the key points from the book *Rich Dad Poor Dad* by Robert Kiyosaki.

[^5]: I heard it from Rick Rubin in his podcast with Huberman (or Lex, I am not fully sure of my memory, but it's one or the other).

[^6]: From David Goggins' book *Never Finished*.

[^7]: According to Anna Lembke, this pleasure/pain balance (or lack of it) is the mechanism of addiction. [Dr. Anna Lembke: Understanding & Treating Addiction | Huberman Lab Podcast #33 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&t=4s).
