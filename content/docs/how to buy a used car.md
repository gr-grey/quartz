## Jack up the car

### wheels
- [ ] rim, scratches, curb rash, bends
- [ ] brake dust on the inside of rim, caliper is seizing or replaced with cheap metallic brake pad

- [ ] grab on the tires at 9 or 3 o'clock and pull the wheel back and forth, check if tire rod ends are worn
- [ ] grab on the tire at 12 and 6 o'clock and pull it back and forth, ball joints are worn
- [ ] pull on other diagonal directions, wheel bearing

- [ ] struts and springs, broken strings, oil leaks from struts
- [ ] the rubber bellows and bump stops at the top

- [ ]  Bounce up and down on each corner of the car to check the struts and then release, if the car bounces up more than one and a half times, that the strut could be blown

### Tire worn out
- middle more worn out,  over inflated.
- outer bands more worn out,  under inflated.
- feel bumps,  every other thread is going high and low, suspension/ struts are worn out. tires absorb the shock, noisy tires
- small cracks, tire is aging and will need to be replaced soon.
- thread depth 
- dot code, week and year of manufactured (lasts 6-10y)
- make, model, and tire size, as well as the thread depth, matches on each axle of the car.

### Under the car
- [ ] overall frame, rust, dents, scuff, frame machine marks, oils of rust proof
- [ ] oil pan, leaks, drain plug not rusting
- [ ] transmission pan, leaks

- [ ] steering rack, where it meets the inner tie rod, leaks

### remove wheel to check brake

- [ ] bushings get worn out, would cause a clucking noise when goinv over bumps 
- [ ] inner drive shaft boot, inner tie rod, leakage
- [ ] stabilizer bar bushing where it attaches to the frame, tug make sure tight (loose can cause noise going over bumps)
- [ ] outer tie rod., no grease or leaking, the bushing is nice and soft, tug to make sure no looseness
- [ ] control arm bushing, make sure that there's no cracks (hard to take out, cause entire steering knuckle has to come off)
- [ ] lower ball joint, it's not leaking and that the bushing is filled with grease.
- [ ] the CV joints are intact and not leaking, (hard to replace) because often at times this axle gets seized to that bearing.
- [ ] rear engine mount, inspect the rubber around it because a lot of times this will fail first causing the other mounts to wear out.
- [ ] at the back, check the tire thread and the tire size to make sure it matches the other side.
- [ ] rotate it to make sure it moves freely and the parking brake is not catching.
- [ ] to wiggle it side to side to check for some play in the wheel bearing.
- [ ] look at the rear struts to make sure the springs are okay and the struts are not leaking.
- [ ] remove the rear wheel and inspect the brakes and the rotors.

### start the car

start it up and listen out for any dry bearings or squeaky belts.
- [ ] all the gauges and lights are working and that when you start the car all of the warning lights disappear.
- [ ] Check the exhaust system after the car has just been started for any repairs or any leaks.
- [ ] Some steam and water on a cold start from the exhaust is okay, but if the smoke is coming out really black or blue, that could indicate the car is burning oil or the valve stem seals are leaking.
	- Sometimes you can also an oily residue on the bumper around the tailpipe.
- [ ] go around an engine and make sure that there's no strange noises.
	- a little bit of valve chatter is okay for an engine this old.
- [ ] put my hand on the engine and rev it a little, see how smooth the engine runs.
	If it's running rough, that means one of the cylinders are misfiring.
- [ ] check the engine blow-by. Usually if there's a lot of air coming out of here, that could indicate that the car has high mileage or that there's a cylinder that's misfiring or has bad compression.
- [ ] With the transmission in park and the vehicle level, check the transmission fluid and make sure it's on the cold mark if the engine is cold.
- [ ] run through the gears on the transmission to see how the engine moves. That could indicate if I've got a bad engine mount.
- [ ] turn on the air conditioner and listen for a change in the idle. Check that the AC clutch and the compressor is engaged. If it's turning on and off consistently, that means it's low on freon.
- [ ] Check that both of the radiator fans are working.
- [ ] Turn the steering wheel lock to lock and listen for any strange noises.
- [ ] Pump the brakes and make sure they become nice and firm and they don't sink down to the ground. That could indicate a bad master cylinder.
- [ ] Drive the engine and see how it sounds.
- [ ] Go through all the gears on the transmission and see how it shifts.
- [ ] do a quick load check on the starter and the battery.
- [ ] turn the headlights on, turn the radio on, turn the wipers on, turn the HVAC system up and then start the car and see how it behaves.
- [ ] have a look underneath the car while it's running to make sure there's nothing leaking.
- [ ] Have a look at the tailpipe residue. If there's a lot of black, thick residue, That means the engine is burning oil.
- [ ] Look where the car has been normally parked and see if you can find any oil residue where it's been leaking.

## Part 3: inside

## Part 4: Test drive
listen to the car at idle.

- [ ] engine: how smoothly it's running or if it's bogging down.
- [ ] any squeaky belts or dry bearings or any exhaust rattles.
- [ ] the dashboard no warning lights.

take this car for a drive.

how the engine's performing.
- [ ] on flat open road accelerate moderately: power of engine
- [ ] how smooth the engine's running. misfiring or bogging down or holding back, indicate a potential issue with the fuel system.

accelerate moderately and check transmission shifts.
- [ ] it doesn't shift at too high of an RPM, or it doesn't shift too hard because that could indicate major problems with the transmission that's very expensive to replace.
- [ ] put it in drive and drive forward, come to a complete stop, put it in reverse and see how long it takes to shift into reverse.
	- We want it to shift right away.
- [ ] put it into drive and see how long it takes to drive.
	- a delay could indicate an issue with the transmission.
- [ ] the cruise control works and it disengages when touch the brakes.

- [ ] the horn works

- [ ] if the steering wheel is straight.
	- indicate an issue with an alignment or a bad tire.
 
- [ ] take the vehicle over a couple of rough roads and listen to the suspension.
- [ ] any clunks or noises coming from the front end. 
	- could indicate a stabilizer linkage that's loose or strut mounts that are popping, a broken spring or even the tie rods.

- [ ] the brakes work properly.
- [ ] step on the brakes firmly as get up to speed here and see how the car reacts.
- [ ] that the car isn't pulling off to one side or another.
	- If the pedal is vibrating, the rotors are warped and will need to be replaced.
	- If it's pulling to one side, the caliper is sticking and that will need to be replaced.

- [ ] checking for brake fade.
- [ ] accelerate to speed and stop and then accelerate again multiple times to get an idea of the consistency of the feel in the brake pedal.
	- Otherwise the pads and rotors are glazed and might need to be replaced.
- [ ]  how the suspension is reacting to the road. 
	- If the suspension is bouncing up and down, especially a lot on the highway, indicate that the struts are blown.

- [ ] At a standstill, test how responsive the throttle of the car is. 
- [ ] Accelerate really really hard to get an idea of the power of the car.
- [ ] see if it pulls to one side or another.
- [ ] under hard acceleration, look for blue smoke coming out the back of the tailpipe. the car is burning oil.

- [ ] bring it up to highway speed, release the steering wheel slightly and see if there's any vibrations.
	- low speed vibrations, the tires are bad and probably a belt is broken and need to be replaced.
	- high speed vibrations, an issue with tire balance or the tire rods are worn.

- [ ] on the highway, listen for wind noise coming from the doors or windows.
	- weather stripping is failing and it's not sealing properly
- [ ] listen for tire noise. tires get louder as they wear out

- [ ] find an empty parking lot to check the steering.
- [ ] turn the wheel lock to lock and listen for any noises or any clicking
	- clicking from a front wheel drive car, the CV joints are bad and will need to be replaced.
	- popping sound or clunking sound, probably the tie rod ends are loose or the strut mount bearings are defective.

- [ ] take the car through some turns
- [ ] steering is nice and smooth and decent feedback from the steering wheel.

- [ ] a good seating position, visibility is okay, okay with the road noise in the interior, okay with the power of the engine, and okay with overall how the car feels

- [ ] the parking brake holds the vehicle.
