I recently went through a tragic event and lost a big chunk of money,
which might have nudged me into listening to the book *Rich Dad Poor Dad* by Robert Kiyosaki.

In the book, Robert offered a great educational course on how money and finance work, and offered a simple and straightforward solution to build up wealth - acquire assets.

Assets generate compounding interests for the rest of our lives, they should be automatic (with minimum maintenance) and just working quietly in the background.

I think the idea of assets also applies to life itself, and we should be thinking about what qualities or skills we can build up, 
that would make us a better person for the rest of our lives.

[[James Clear]] talked about the same idea of compounding and investing in yourself in his best selling book *Atomic Habits*, and [[Sam Altman]] wrote a blog [How To Be Successful](https://blog.samaltman.com/how-to-be-successful), in which the first thing he mentioned was "Compound yourself".

Sometimes I would avoid/ procrastinate to do things or face some challenge for so long, and by the time I finally handled it, usually through gritted teeth, a huge load of struggle, discomfort, unwillingness, anxiety and self-blame, I would feel this huge relief and think:

*Man, I should've done this earlier.*

I think it's a good practice to ask myself once in a while:
what are the things that in 5 years, I'd be looking back and say, man, I really should've done it earlier?

Those are probably things I should start working on *now*.

Here are several things that I want to grow in my personal asset column, that I think can compound and serve me for the rest of my life.

(Hopefully I'll come back to elaborate them 🤞.)

- Patience.

- Courage.

- Hope and generosity.

- Information, knowledge and mindsets.

- Attention.

- Patience + focus attention -> one step at a time. Hold on. Endurance.

- Infrastructures and foundations for growth. Habits like One blog a day.
