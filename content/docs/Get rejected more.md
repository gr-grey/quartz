I am deeply afraid of rejection.
And I've recently realized how much missed opportunity that has cost me.

There is this line in *The sunscreen song*:
> do one thing that scares you everyday.

And I think a good practice is to try to get rejected everyday.
I might be surprised how far that will lead me.
