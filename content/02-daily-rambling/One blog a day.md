I want to build a habit of putting out one blog everyday.

They don't have to be good, in fact I expect most of them to be crappy (like this one).

The point is to get rid of the friction and get into action -
it's the mental version of "making my bed every morning".

I am recently reading *Tools of Titans* by [[03-my-people/Tim Ferriss|Tim Ferriss]], it's a collection of people Tim has interviewed on his podcast.

In the segment with *Whitney Cummings*, she mentioned for a doing stand-up comedies, "the material is 10% of it".

She said the best way to get better at stand-up is to get on stage - just get on stage every night, *whether you have material or not*, because the material is like 10% of it.

The first two years of standup is just getting comfortable on stage, your material doesn't matter.

I think this might apply to writing as well, both articles and codes. The first couple of months (or years) is just to get comfortable with the settings - editors, compilers, packages, environmental stuff.

Just write, *whether you have material or not*.

Write one piece on anything, it doesn't matter.

Write code that's bad, it doesn't matter.

It's about practice. Keep writing, and eventually something good will pop up.

One tiny step, just one.
