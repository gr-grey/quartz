[[Sam Altman]] said that it's easier for a start-up to survive when they work on hard problems.
People are drawn to hard problems, it's easier to get good talents, and because most people think the problem is too hard to solve, you have less competition.

I wonder if this is a more universal [[Paradoxes|paradox]].

I am thinking about a goal that feels impossible to achieve, and I spent a good chunk of my morning trying to solve the puzzle:
is there anyway I could somehow make it a reality.
And it's been very intriguing and fun, and I think it's something that my limbic system, my emotional brain really cares about.

I feel excited, and am curious how this is going to turn out.
I am trying to define a clear goal, with a clear measurement and deadline.

In a way I need to bend reality with my will and pull off a miracle, and I don't think I can do it on my own.

Game on.
Let's go.
