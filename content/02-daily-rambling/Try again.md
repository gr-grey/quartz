I am failing the [[Slow carb diet]]. 
The rule of "no simple carbs for six days a week", this completely man-made scarcity, has fueled my craving and caused great stress and fear for me.

According to recent records, I just can't keep the diet recently. I keep breaking the rules, for social reasons, for stress reasons, or just flat out didn't want to comply.

Yesterday I ate probably a total of 2 pounds of cakes, crackers, cookies and granola bars.

And it was not my [[food log|cheat day]].

It takes courage to face the failure, and instead of getting angry and slip into the less resisting path of low effort negativity, I think it's better to stay calm and say:

So that didn't work, try again.

But try something new, try to fail differently this time.

Since I constantly break my diet when I'm with other people.
I thought I'd try this new rule, it's simple (but probably hard).

- Avoid *simple* carbs whenever I can.
- Eat one meal a day whenever I can.
- Try to only eat while others are around.

It seems most of my binging episodes happen when I'm alone - a lot of dark down spirals do.
Other people's existence might be a good guarding mechanism, and it might help pushing me out to make more friends.
I don't even have to talk to them, they just need to be around.

And eat carbs if I can't curb the urge - 
I know this is subjective and it introduces the chaos and might cause harm, but I am trying to give the body more autonomy. 

I have to believe the body and mind has aligned common interest, that they both want the best for this organism, and having a healthy strong body, living a long, happy life is at the core of it. 

Give the unconscious mind more credit.
Maybe the forced carb eating is the body trying to save us from depression.
