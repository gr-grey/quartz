I came back to Philly last night for thanksgiving, after relocating to Dallas in August.

This morning I felt the compelling urge to run to the [[Goodbye, Schuylkill | Schuylkill river]] trail.

I was worried about the fatigue from traveling, but my body was excited, like a kid set loose in a playground.

I was hit with loads of nostalgic senses, memories and images flooded my head.
Language seems pale in describing the bright, colorful, pounding excitement of running by the river again.

A sunny, brisk early winter Philly morning induced certain neurochemical molecules circulating my brain that felt like magic.

In the spirit of the holiday, I remembered how grateful I am to the Schuylkill river.

The river and trail have taught me so much, about running, about thinking, about reconnecting with my body, about how to live.

I came back to the river a bit older and more seasoned, and hopefully stronger, kinder, and with more wisdom.

I thought of a quote from T.S. Eliot:

> [!quote] &nbsp;
> We shall not cease from exploration <br>
> And the end of all our exploring <br>
> Will be to arrive where we started <br>
> And know the place for the first time. <br>
> Through the unknown, unremembered gate

And another from [[Kevin Kelly]]:

>[!quote]  &nbsp;
>That thing that made you weird as a kid <br>
> could make you great as an adult <br>
> —if you don’t lose it.

I hope running on that trail will always feel like a kid coming home.
