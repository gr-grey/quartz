Today I said my goodbye to the Schuylkill river by taking a long walk along the river trail.

I walked past the art museum.

I walked past the mark for my usual 6 miles run. 

I walked past the geese and ducks and birds that survived the winter with me.

I walked past the cemetery where I wondered how many people have died without knowing they were capable of running a half marathon.

I walked up north till I get lost and didn't know where the trail was.

I walked down south till the construction point ended the trail temporarily. 

I walked through the point where I cursed the universe during my first (stupid) half marathon.

I walked till my fitbit died out of battery.

I walked till my feet hurt and my legs hurt and I didn't want to walk anymore.

I walked from 7:30 am to 3 pm.
I walked a little more than 26 miles.

I had finished my first marathon along the river, and I didn't want that to be the last one.

Problem is, I hadn't ran a single mile in the past month, so I figured running a full marathon is beyond my capability at this point, but figured I might be able to walk it.
I can walk a sub 15 min mile, so a total of 6.5 h will do.

It was hard and stupid, but it felt like the right thing to do.

The last hour was brutal, with Philly's 95 F (35C) summer heat.
But knowing that it'll be the last time I am close to Schuylkill (at least for a while) helped me pushing on.

> Dear Schuylkill,

> Thank you for the walks and runs and the good times with friends along the trail.
> 
> Thank you for listening to my problems.

> Thank you for the sunburn today.

> Thank you for being there as I ran through the darkest days of my life.

> Goodbye. I will miss you dearly.

Remember when you went crazy and flooded half of center city?
Good time.
