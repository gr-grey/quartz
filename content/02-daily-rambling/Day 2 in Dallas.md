summary: "it's hard to start"
---

I arrived in Dallas from Philly yesterday.
and instead of being all excited about starting a new life, I feel very tired, and a little homesick.

It's hard to leave all the comfort and familiarity behind in Philly and start anew.
I knew where to work, where to exercise, where to get grocery. I knew my apartment.

I knew the weather, the streets, the stores.
I knew how the city looks, sounds and smells like.

I have people that I love and care deeply there.

All of that is gone now.

Damn, I thought I'd miss the old life,
didn't think it'd come this fast.

Maybe it comes from the sadness of all the goodbyes I've been saying, 
maybe from the exhaustion of cleaning out my apartment in the past week - throwing away most stuff I've got was emotionally way more tasking than the physical work it required,
maybe from the list of less exciting tasks that is currently occupying my mind, updating addresses, onboard paperwork, transitional stuff.

And a big source of stress probably comes from the fear of uncertainty.

I feel paralyzed by the things I need to do, the new contacts I need to make, and I did not want to write this blog, even though I know doing so will help me gain a bit more energy, to give me a small sense of achievement.

I am hopeful though.
The tiredness will fade,
the hard time will pass,
and we adapt to new places,
we are adapting machines, and we're so good at it.

Hello Dallas, I hope we have some fun together ❤️
