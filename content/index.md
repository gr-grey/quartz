title: Where thoughts crystalize
---

Merely thinking might not solve your problem, but writing it down might.

This website uses [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/), which takes many inspirations (*ahem, copys*) from the note taking app [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

Quartz helps you build a digital garden, where thoughts are cultivated organically. It starts from a seed/ sapling, and grows over time, it might branch out, its root might reach out and intertwine with others, and a simple seed can transform and mature into a ripe fruit of thought.

An obsidian or other crystals is also a good analogy. Thoughts start in an ocean of chaos, and gradually come to order, a tiny cystal core forms, and other bits deposit into the lattice over time - thoughts crystalize into a beautiful theory.

Sometimes thoughts go through high pressure and high temperature and form a hard core, tightly packed little spec of wonder - diamond, that shines brightly under the sun.
